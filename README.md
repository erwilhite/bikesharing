In this first graph, it can be seen that the average trip duration is around 10 minutes, and nearly all trips are less than an hour long. The second graph expands on the first, and just breaks down these trips by gender. From this it can be seen that the trips duration trends are nearly the same across genders, but male riders are the overwhelming majority of riders. The third graph shows that the most popular times to rent bikes are between 7-10AM and 5-7PM throughout the week and pretty consistently all day on the weekends. The fourth graph expands on the third graph and breaks the times down by gender. This graph is similar to the second graph in that it mimics the trends of the one it expands on, with male riders still being the primary gender renting. The last graph shows that more of the bikes are rented out by subsribers. 

## Summary:

In conclusion, this analysis does a comprehensive job of breaking down and visualizing the populations using CitiBikes in NYC. It concludes that most of the renters are male, the most popular times to rent bikes are between 7-10AM and 5-7PM throughout the week, and that subscribers are largely the group renting the bikes. This interpretations can be used to draw up marketing and analysis plans for a similar business in Iowa. From the data set a couple more graphs that could help in the analysis could be the number of trips by age and subscriber trip duration vs nonsubscriber trip duration. These could allow some further interpretations as to the intent of the bike ride and whether it is for a commute or for fun. Another graph that would require more data collection, but provide a more comprehensive analysis, would be adding in the weather and number of rides.
